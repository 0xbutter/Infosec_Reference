		* [Navigating Career Choices in InfoSec - Fernando Montenegro - BSides Detroit2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM2xCjrQSY4)
			* Making career choices can be intimidating and stressful. Perhaps this presentation can help. The tidal forces affecting technology impact our careers as well. If we're not actively managing them, we're leaving decisions to chance (or to others), and may not like the outcomes. This presentation describes a framework I've used over the past few years to evaluate both ongoing job satisfaction as well as new opportunities as they appear. I'm happy with the outcomes I've obtained with it, and have used this same framework when providing advice to others, and it has been well received. Hopefully it can help others as well.

			* In this presentation we'll will be going over introductions to the various focuses in information security and demoing the most common tools that are used in operational security, both offense and defense. You'll leave with an idea on how to freely obtain and use these tools so that you can have what you need for that first interview: experience and a passion for security. This is a green talk for people who don't have a clue on what offensive and defensive people do operationally, from a tool perspective.

			* [So you think you want to be a penetration tester - Defcon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)
				* So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks, migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams, how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information, laughter and fun.

		* Worthwhile for the first comment in response to the article: "I don’t see anything “senior” about it, or even “engineer”.  Seeing problems and solving them is what everyone does.  Documenting the solution is one part of solving a problem.  An apprentice carpenter does these things, too, and so does a farmer, and a waiter.  Unfortunately, it’s not what most software companies reward, or how they operate.  Whenever I did this, my manager, at every software company I’ve worked for, would say:  “That’s cool, but you’re supposed to add the FooBar feature, and it needs to be done this Friday.  Don’t waste time with reverse-engineering, or documentation.  Just add one new field to the protocol somewhere.  We can clean it up Later(TM).”  This is Conway’s Law at work.  What sort of company encourages the creation of two critical components which are completely undocumented?  The sort of company which doesn’t reward documentation of critical components.  That’s not likely to change because the engineer that created them happened to leave.  (It took more time to reverse-engineer the protocol than it would have to document it when the knowledge was fresh.)  The PM and QA who allowed this to happen are still there, right?  What “Senior Engineer” really means is someone who’s spent enough time in the trenches to have earned a job title that allows them the latitude to make these sorts of improvements, and not have a PM question why they aren’t, instead, doing exactly what they were assigned.  Look back at the story.  Did the “senior engineer” go through proper channels to schedule a “reverse-engineer and document network protocol” task?  No, he clearly didn’t trust that it would happen.  Or maybe it was already there, but lowest priority (way below “fix CSS on IE”, of course).  What was his actual responsibility that week?  The story doesn’t say, but I don’t see any remarks about a PM breathing down his neck asking about the CSS fix he asked for (because that PM is the only user of the system, anywhere, of course, who uses IE and sees that particular bug).  Documentation is not on this week’s “Sprint”!  The process is fundamentally broken.  We hear fables like this about how life would be better if we all did something one way (you’ll get promoted to Senior Engineer!), while in practice we’re punished for doing so."
