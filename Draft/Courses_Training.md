	* [SEEDLabs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/all_labs.html)
		* People learn from mistakes. In security education, we study mistakes that lead to software vulnerabilities. Studying mistakes from the past not only help students understand why systems are vulnerable, why a "seemly-benign" mistake can turn into a disaster, and why many security mechanisms are needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common patterns of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. Moreover, using vulnerabilities as case studies, students can learn the principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.

		* Abstract: As of January 2014, the Microsoft Windows operating system series maintains over a 90% market share in the global market of computing1 . This fact alone helps explain why Windows is the most commonly targeted platform for malicious exploitation by hackers, organizations, and nation states alike. With years of relentless exploitation, great strides have been made by Microsoft in securing their operating system through numerous exploit mitigation techniques from the Windows XP era onwards. This course will explore the tools, a number of mitigations, and their associated bypass techniques that are utilized in most modern exploits on the Windows platform. The outcome of this course will leave one with the ability to analyze real world vulnerabilities and develop reliable exploits from end to end for Windows XP – Windows 7 systems.

	* [Introduction to Computer Networking(Stanford) - Philip Levis, Nick McKeown](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking-SP/SelfPaced/about)
		* This is a self-paced introductory course on computer networking, specifically the Internet. It focuses on explaining how the Internet works, ranging from how bits are modulated on wires and in wireless to application-level protocols like BitTorrent and HTTP. It also explains the principles of how to design networks and network protocols. Students gain experience reading and understanding RFCs (Internet protocol specifications) as statements of what a system should do. The course grounds many of the concepts in current practice and recent developments, such as net neutrality and DNS security. A textbook is recommended, but not required: you can use either Peterson and Davie or Kurose and Ross, any version in the past 5 years will do.

	* [Beginner Network Pentesting - The Cyber Mentor](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/Beginner-Network-Pentesting)
		* Welcome to the Beginner Network Pentesting course. Previously, the course was delivered weekly on Twitch and built from lessons learned in the previous week. The course provides an opportunity for those interested in becoming an ethical hacker / penetration tester the chance to learn the practical skills necessary to work in the field. Throughout the course, we will develop our own Active Directory lab in Windows, make it vulnerable, hack it, and patch it. We'll cover the red and blue sides. We'll also cover some of the boring stuff like report writing :).
	* [Penetration Test Guide based on the OWASP + Extra](https://github.com/Voorivex/pentest-guide)
		* This guid[e] is for the penetration testers seeking for the appropriate test cases required during a penetration test project. I rearranged the OWASP Testing Guide v4 from my point of view including 9 Test Classes and each class has several Test Cases to conduct against the target. Each Test Case covers several OWASP tests which also is useful for the report document. I've also added 14 extra Tests Cases marked by the EXTRA-TEST. I hope it will be useful in both penetration test projects and bug-bounty.

			* Different targets for x86 assembly object files generation. (E.g. relocatable vs. position independent code).  
			* Linking object files together to create a well-formed binary.  
			* Detailed descriptions of the high level similarities and low level differences between the Windows PE and Linux ELF binary formats. (NOTE: we didn't get to this in the class where the video was recorded, but the materials are in the slides)
			* How an OS loads a binary into memory and links it on the fly before executing it.   
			* Along the way we discuss the relevance of security at different stages of a binary’s life, from the tricks that can be played by a malicious compiler, to how viruses really work, to the way which malware “packers” duplicate OS process execution functionality, to the benefit of a security-enhanced OS loader which implements address space layout randomization (ASLR).

	* [Binary Analysis Course - Max Kersten](https://maxkersten.nl/binary-analysis-course/)
		* This course starts at the very start, where it is assumed that the reader has little to no low level knowledge. It is expected that the reader is able to understand basic programming aspects such as functions/methods, variables, types and system calls. Unlike most courses, this course aims to only use free and open-source software. This way, everybody can participate and follow the course, whereas most other courses are focused on proprietary tools which cost up to thousands of dollars. This won’t exclude such tools from being used in additional examples later on, but they will not be used as the sole tool in an example. As the course progresses, the material gets more in-depth and complex. Throughout the chapters, there are practical cases included. These cases serve two purposes. Firstly, the reader is greeted with a puzzle every once in a while, instead of pure theory. Secondly, it provides insight in the reader’s learning curve with the help of a given case.

	* [Program Obfuscation, Fall 2013 - CSCI](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/obfuscation-fall2013/syllabus.pdf)
		* The issue of program protection has never been more relevant. Commerical software companies need techniques to protect their intellectual property, malware authors try to slow the down the process of reversing and detecting their creations, and nation-states are creating cyber-weapons that they do not want reverse engineered and repurposed. Program protection is has two main approaches, tamper-resistance and obfuscation. Tamperresistance focuses on the detection and corruption of tools used to analyze programs. Obfuscation focuses on making a program hard to understand, even when under flawless analysis tools. Tamper-resistance techniques tend to be an arms race, of one off tricks versus analysis tool updates. Obfuscation offers a much more stable and provably secure avenue in which to protect programs. Obfuscation is thorougly grounded in the formal methods and proofs of cryptography. The only distinction between obfuscation and cryptography is the location of the key. In cryptography, the key is outside the system or data under analysis. In obfuscation, the obfuscated data and key are together, making it a challenging problem of its own. It is the difficulty of provable security and the great need program protection in the current day, that make this class relevant and necessary. In this readings class, we will focus on 15 of the most important works in program obfuscation. We will attain thorough understanding of these papers through paper reviews, discussion, and a project implementing an obfuscation scheme from one of the papers.

		* Evidence for the superiority of guided instruction is explained in the context of our knowledge of human cognitive architecture, expert–novice differences, and cognitive load. Although unguided or minimally guided instructional approaches are very popular and intuitively appealing, the point is made that these approaches ignore both the structures that constitute human cognitive architecture and evidence from empirical studies over the past half-century that consistently indicate that minimally guided instruction is less effective and less efficient than instructional approaches that place a strong emphasis on guidance of the student learning process. The advantage of guidance begins to recede only when learners have sufficiently high prior knowledge to provide “internal” guidance. Recent developments in instructional research and instructional designmodels that support guidance during instruction are briefly described.

		* The prevailing image of the computer represents it as a logical machine and computer programming as a technical, mathematical activity. Both the popular and technical culture have constructed computation as the ultimate embodiment of the abstract and formal. Yet the computer's intellectual personality has another side: our research finds diversity in the practice of computing that is denied by its social construction. When we looked closely at programmers in action we saw formal and abstract approaches; but we also saw highly successful programmers in relationships with their material that are more reminiscent of a painter than a logician. They use concrete and personal approaches to knowledge that are far from the cultural stereotypes of formal mathematics.'
	* ["How to teach programming (and other things)?" by Felienne Hermans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ&app=desktop)
		* Everyone should learn programming, right? Yes! But how... Should we allow children to explore and learn about syntax on their own, or should we drill programming like we rote memorize the table of multiplication or German grammatical cases? Felienne's talk outlines this history of programming education and didactics beliefs in programming that lead to the prevalence of exploratory forms of teaching, starting with Papert's LOGO. She will then explore programming education in relation to mathematics and language education and explore how rote learning could look like for programming. Felienne will discuss her own research into misconceptions and code phonology as means to teach programming more effectively.
